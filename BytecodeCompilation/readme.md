# Bytecode Compilation
This folder contains different applications in C# and CIL. These examples are used to demonstrate the differences between high-level code and bytecode. The examples contain executable applications and libraries. The library files can not be executed, but they can be disassembled to view the generated bytecode.  

[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) ships with [ILDasm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/ildasm-exe-il-disassembler) that can be used to disassemble the built applications. Additional desktop tools include [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) and [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/). In addition to desktop application [sharplab.io](https://sharplab.io/) can be used in the browser.

### Hello World
Simple hello world application in C# and CIL.

### Lowering
Lowering/desugaring is used to remove syntactic sugar during bytecode compilation.

### Foreach
The `foreach` statement exists in C# but not in CIL.

### Properties
C# property and auto-property examples and compiled CIL versions.
